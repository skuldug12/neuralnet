# neuralnet

this is raw, importless code for a skeleton of a input/sigmoid neuron-based neural net. using network.setup when importing (ONCE FINISHED) will allow a raw neural net to be made of set size and individual weights and biases for each neuron. a learning algorithm can be initiated to tweak the net. input neurons only work with either 0/1 for activation.

# important

better, finished code will be pushed soon. status of code on github: not working
